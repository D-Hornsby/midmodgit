unfinished, still a work in progress 


# midmodgit
carousel

This project is being created so that I can share the trip I took with my dad and my aunt that had never been out west with others that were on the trip with us and frends and family that might also like to see the adventure.  
The idea is that I can put this on the web so they can view from there homes during this pandemic. 
I can add more states or trips and build out this page to later include other places from this trip or other trips as well. 
At some point i would like to make it so users can log on and add pics and comments of there own. 
I would also like at some point to add a long and lat to pin point where pics were taken. 
All in all this project is to share the documentation pictures online so others can see them. 

This build is not complete. The cards need to be linked to my carousel and many pics need to be added. 
Home button needs to be linked back up but my DLH will take you home. 
There is no backend to this signup form. 
I wanted to use the hamburger buttons for either my glass to slide out with the cards or for my moble which still needs work to flex porperly. 
There is css that needs to be added to my form and to my carousel. 
The form may be changed. I was going to add a pic on the left with form on the right and then when you get loggin in a page for success. This has not been done yet.
